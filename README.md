# Recommendation-Algorithm
Companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook provide us with personalised feeds. 
Have you ever wondered how they are able to achieve this? In 2009, Netflix kept a prize money of 1 million dollars for building the recommendation system better by 10%. Earlier, our feeds used to be sorted on time-basis. But, now everyone's feed is different because each one has unalike interests.
